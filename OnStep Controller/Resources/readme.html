<h2>First Things First</h2>
<p>Welcome. Gotomote is a very special project to <a href="https://github.com/29satnam/">me</a>. I&#8217;m proud to say that it&#8217;s a part of the project OnStep. OnStep is a DIY computerized Goto controller for Telescope mounts. <a href="https://groups.io/g/onstep/wiki/home">OnStep</a> is led by <a href="https://github.com/hjd1964">Howard Dutton</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hjd1964">Khalid Baheyeldin</a>. Hundreds of hours of work have gone into OnStep, and we&#8217;re dedicated to making it better every day. Thank you for making it part of your world.</p>

<h2>Initilization: Setting up and Alignment</h2>
<ol>
	<li>This App controls through Wi-Fi from your iPhone or iPad. Go to your device's Settings > Wi-Fi > Connect with your Goto&#8217;s Wi-Fi.</li>
	<li>In the app tap on more button. It will open up a list of settings.
		<ol>
			<li>Tap on &#8217;Connection&#8217; that will take you to Connection settings page.</li>
			<li>Add IP Address and Port to access point. Wi-Fi connections in access-point mode defaults to address 192.168.0.1</li>
			<li>Then just tap &#8217;Save&#8217;. This is just one time thing, then app will always remember your IP Address and Port.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>At top-right side, on landing screen tap more button and then tap on &#8217;Site Selection&#8217;. Add your Site name, Latitude, Longitude, UTC Offset, and then tap Upload. Server should revert with a success message.</li>
	<li>On landing screen, tap Initialize/Park. Then tap Date/Time button. This will update time on the Goto server.</li>
    <li>Now that OnStep has the correct site information and date/time you can start an Align.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>A list of suitable stars will be displayed to choose from.</li>
        <li>Pick a bright easily identified star not too close to the NCP/SCP and do a goto.</li>
        <li>Depending on your configuration, up to 3 stars may be used.</li>
        <li>If the mount is well constructed and polar aligned and OnStep was setup correctly the star should be in a wide field eyepiece of a small telescope or in your finder &#8217;scope.</li>
        <li>Use the guide controls to center the star in the eyepiece.</li>
        <li>Finally, select &#34;Align&#34; on the direction pad. If more alignment stars are required the list of stars will reappear and this sequence will repeat until done.</li>
    </ol>
</ol>
<h2>FAQ:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Two star and three start alignment isn&#8217;t working?</li>
    <dd>&#8212; Two star and three star align is not supported with Fork mounts in alternate mode.</dd>
    <li>PEC isn&#8217;t?</li>
    <dd>&#8212; PEC is not supported with AlT/AZM mounts, for rest all mount types it should work.</dd>
    <li>Goto speed is too slow/fast?</li>
    <dd>&#8212; You might want to increase/decrease the MaxRate, it&#8217;s possible to change from app upto 2x.</dd>
    <li>There&#8217;s a bug/crash you&#8217;d want to report?</li>
